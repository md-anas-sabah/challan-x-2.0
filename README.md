We are going to create a AI based Traffic Challan system that will mainly target the vehicles prohibiting the traffic rules in the areas where our traffic department are unable to reach. Basically, it will be known as a challan generating system in every smartphone. This project will help the police as well as the public in regulating the traffic system.
